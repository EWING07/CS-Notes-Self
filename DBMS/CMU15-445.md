## Lecture #01: Relational Model & Relational Algebra

### 1 Database

Definition: an organized collection of inter-related data that models some aspects of the real-world.

Databases are core the component of most computer apps.

DBMS is different from databases.

### 2. Flat File Strawman

Database is stored as comma-separeted value(CSV) files that the DBMS manages.

#### Issues with Flat File

- Data Integrity
- Implementation
- Durability

### 3. Database Management System

a DBMS is software that allows applications to store and analyze information in a database.

allow the definition, creation, querying, updating, and administration of databases.

The logic layer is  which entities and attributes the database has while the physical layer is how those entities and attributes are being stored.

### 4. Relational Model

3 key points:

- Store database in simple data stcutures(relations)
- access data through high-level language.
- physical storage left up to implementation

a data model is a collection of concepts for describing the data in a database. (relational model is an example  of a data model)

a *schema* is  a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.

The relational data model defines three concepts:

- **Structure**: the definition of relations and their contents. this is the attributes the relations have and the values that those attributes can hold.
- **Integrity**: ensure the database's contents satisfy constraints.
- **Manipulation**: how to access and modify a database's contents

#### Keys

a primary key uniquely identifies a single tuple. 

a foreign key specifies that an attribute from one relation has to map to a tuple in anotehr relation

### 5. Data Manipulation Language

a language to store and retrieve information from a database.

- **Procedural**: the query specifies the strategy the DBMS should use to find the desired result.
- **Non-Procedura**l: the query specifies only what data is wanted and not how to find it.

### 6. Relational Algebra

a set of fundamental operations to retrieve and manipulate tuples in a relation. (is a procedural language cuz it defines the high level-steps of how to compute a query)

*Select, Projection, Union, Intersection, Difference, Product, Join*

**Join**: Join takes in two relations and outputs a relation that contains all the tuples that are a combination of two tuples where for each attribute that the two relations share, the values for that attrubite of both tuples is the same.

### Conclusion

Databases are ubiquitous

Relational algebra defines the primitives for processing queries on a relational database.

## Lecture #02: Advanced SQL

#### 1 Relational Languages

Relational algebra is based on sets, SQL is based on bags

#### 2 SQL History

Comprised of 3 classes of commands:

- DML: `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`
- DDL: Schema definition
- DCL: Security, access control

SQL-92 is the minimum that a DBMS has to support

#### 3 Aggregates

#### 4 String Operations

#### 5 Output Redirection

#### 6 Output Control

Order By: impose a sort on tuples

LIMIT: restrict the number of result tuples

#### 7 Nested Queries

#### 8 Window Functions

- **Functions**: can be any of the aggregation functions that we discussed above. can also be a special window functions:
  - `ROW_NUMBER`: the number of the current row
  - `RANK`: the order position of the current row
- **Grouping**: The `OVER` clause specifies how to group together tuples when computing the window function. Use `PARTITION` BY to specify group.
- **Important**: The DBMS computes `RANK` after the window function sorting, whereas it computes `ROW NUMBER`before the sorting.

#### 9 [Common Table Expression](https://sqlite.org/lang_with.html)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are an alternative to windows or nested queries to writing more complex queries. One can think of a CTE like a temporary table for just one query.

## Lecture #03 Database Storage (Part I)

### 1. Storage

File storage page layout tuple layout

1. foucs on a disk-oriented DBMS that primary storage location of the databses is on non-volatile disk
2. **Volatile Devices:** 
   - Volatile means that if you pull the power from the machine, then the data is lost. 
   - Volatile storage supports fast random access with byte-addressable locations. This means that the program can jump to any byte address and get the data that is there. 
   - For our purposes, we will always refer to this storage class as “memory”
3. **Non-Volatile Devices:**
   - Non-volatile means that the storage device does not need to be provided continuous power in order for the device to retain the bits that it is storing. 
   - It is also block/page addressable. This means that in order to read a value at a particular offset, the program first has to load the 4 KB page into memory that holds the value the program wants to read. 
   - Non-volatile storage is traditionally better at sequential access (reading multiple chunks of data at the same time). 
   - We will refer to this as “disk”. We will not make a (major) distinction between solid-state storage (SSD) or spinning hard drives (HDD).

### 2. Disk-Oriented DBMS Overview

### 3. DBMS vs. OS

High-level design goal is like virtual memory, where there us a large addres space and a place for the OS to bring in pages from disk.

We do not advise using `mmap` in a DBMS for correctness and performance reasons. Even though the system will have functionalities that seem like something the OS can provide, Having the DBMS implement these procedures itself gives it better control and performance.

### 4. File Storage

a DBMS stores a database as files on disk.

The OS does not know anything about the contents of these files. Only the DBMS knows how to decipher their contents, since it is encoded in a way specific to the DBMS.

The DBMS’s `storage manager` is responsible for managing a database’s files. It represents the files as a collection of pages. It also keeps track of what data has been read and written to pages, as well how much free space there is in the pages

### 5. Database pages 

![image-20201023170027798](image-20201023170027798.png)

Most DBMSs have an indirection layer that maps a page id to a file path and offset.

There are three concepts of pages in DBMS: 

1. Hardware page (usually 4 KB). 
2. OS page (4 KB). 
3. Database page (1-16 KB).

### 6. Database Heap

A heap file is an unordered collection of pages where tuples are stored in random order.

The DBMS can locate a page on disk given a page id by using a linked list of pages or a page directory. 

- **Linked List**: Header page holds pointers to to a list of free pages and a list of data pages. However, if the DBMS is looking for a specific page, it has to do a sequential scan on the data page list until it finds the page it is looking for. 
- **Page Directory**: DBMS maintains special pages that track locations of data pages along with the amount of free space on each page.

### 7. Page Layout

Every page includes a header that records meta-data about the page’s contents: 

- Page size. 
- Checksum. 
- DBMS version. 
- Transaction visibility. 
- Some systems require pages to be self-contained (e.g oracle)

2 main approaches laying out data in pages:

1. **Slotted-pages**: pages maps slots to offsets
   - Most common approach used in DBMSs today. 
   - Header keeps track of the number of used slots and the offset of the starting location of last used slot and a slot array, which keeps track of the location of the start of each tuple. 
   - To add a tuple, the slot array will grow from the beginning to the end, and the data of the tuples will grow from end to the beginning. The page is considered full when the slot array and the tuple data meet.
2. **Log-structured**:  Instead of storing tuples, the DBMS only stores log records.
   - Stores records to file of how the database was modified (insert, update, deletes). 
   - To read a record, the DBMS scans the log file backwards and “recreates” the tuple. 
   - Fast writes, potentially slow reads. 
   - Works well on append-only storage because the DBMS cannot go back and update the data. 
   - To avoid long reads the DBMS can have indexes to allow it to jump to specific locations in the log. It can also periodically compact the log (if it had a tuple and then made an update to it, it could compact it down to just inserting the updated tuple). The issue with compaction is the DBMS ends up with write amplification (it re-writs the same data over and over again).

### 8. Tuple Layout

A tuple is essentially a sequence of bytes. It is DBMS’s job to interpret those bytes into attribute types and values. 

**Tuple Header**: Contains meta-data about the tuple. 

- Visibility information for the DBMS’s concurrency control protocol (i.e., information about which transaction created/modified that tuple). 
- Bit Map for NULL values. 
- Note that the DBMS does not need to store meta-data about the schema of the database here. 

**Tuple Data**: Actual data for attributes. 

- Attributes are typically stored in the order that you specify them when you create the table. 
- Most DBMSs do not allow a tuple to exceed the size of a page.

**Unique Identifier**: 

- Each tuple in the database is assigned a unique identifier. 
- Most common: page id + (offset or slot). 
- An application cannot rely on these ids to mean anything.

**Denormalized Tuple Data**: If two tables are related, the DBMS can “pre-join” them, so the tables end up on the same page. This makes reads faster since the DBMS only has to load in one page rather than two separate pages, but it makes updates more expensive since the DBMS needs more space for each tuple.
