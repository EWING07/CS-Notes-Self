## Lecture #01: Relational Model & Relational Algebra

### 1 Database

Definition: an organized collection of inter-related data that models some aspects of the real-world.

Databases are core the component of most computer apps.

DBMS is different from databases.

### 2. Flat File Strawman

Database is stored as comma-separeted value(CSV) files that the DBMS manages.

#### Issues with Flat File

- Data Integrity
- Implementation
- Durability

### 3. Database Management System

a DBMS is software that allows applications to store and analyze information in a database.

allow the definition, creation, querying, updating, and administration of databases.

The logic layer is  which entities and attributes the database has while the physical layer is how those entities and attributes are being stored.

### 4. Relational Model

3 key points:

- Store database in simple data stcutures(relations)
- access data through high-level language.
- physical storage left up to implementation

a data model is a collection of concepts for describing the data in a database. (relational model is an example  of a data model)

a *schema* is  a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.

The relational data model defines three concepts:

- **Structure**: the definition of relations and their contents. this is the attributes the relations have and the values that those attributes can hold.
- **Integrity**: ensure the database's contents satisfy constraints.
- **Manipulation**: how to access and modify a database's contents

#### Keys

a primary key uniquely identifies a single tuple. 

a foreign key specifies that an attribute from one relation has to map to a tuple in anotehr relation

### 5. Data Manipulation Language

a language to store and retrieve information from a database.

- **Procedural**: the query specifies the strategy the DBMS should use to find the desired result.
- **Non-Procedura**l: the query specifies only what data is wanted and not how to find it.

### 6. Relational Algebra

a set of fundamental operations to retrieve and manipulate tuples in a relation. (is a procedural language cuz it defines the high level-steps of how to compute a query)

*Select, Projection, Union, Intersection, Difference, Product, Join*

**Join**: Join takes in two relations and outputs a relation that contains all the tuples that are a combination of two tuples where for each attribute that the two relations share, the values for that attrubite of both tuples is the same.

### Conclusion

Databases are ubiquitous

Relational algebra defines the primitives for processing queries on a relational database.
